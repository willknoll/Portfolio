# Volpin Props Shipping Crate Calculator

This code is an implementation of an online tool, which calculates the part dimensions required to build a shipping crate that will accomodate a particular item.

>Note: The CSS styling is coded to accomodate the layout of the WordPress page in which the final tool resides. (http://www.volpinprops.com/shipping-crate-calculator)
>The page will not render correctly if [sc_calculator.html](sc_calculator.html) is loaded directly.

Inputs Required:  Length, width, and height of the item to be placed in the shipping crate.
Optional inputs:  Plywood, frame, and padding thickness values. Default recommended values are provided, but may be changed.

Default units are imperial, but may be switched to metric.

Based upon the inputs, the tool will calculate the dimensions of all pieces required to build the crate (except the padding). 
A printable view of the calculated input is also provided.
